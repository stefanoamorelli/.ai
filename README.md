# AI Dotfiles

My personal collection of AI configurations and dotfiles.

## What's Inside

- **Claude Code** configurations (agents, commands, output styles, prompts)
- **Shared resources** (shell scripts, templates, snippets)

## Usage

Source the Claude wrapper function:

```bash
source claude/shared/shell/claudio.sh
```

Then use `claudio` instead of `claude` for enhanced privacy and convenience.
